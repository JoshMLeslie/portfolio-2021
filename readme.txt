Dual React / Angular app bootstrapped with simple Index.html at top level

Adapted from: https://dev.to/dcodeyt/building-a-single-page-app-without-frameworks-hl9

Dev:
$ npm i
$ npm run watch

The top-level index.html gets copied to dist for the sake of a pipeline, but is otherwise unchanged

Deploy:
$ npm run deploy

Written / dev tested on:
Linux 5.11.0-25-generic #27~20.04.1-Ubuntu x86_64
